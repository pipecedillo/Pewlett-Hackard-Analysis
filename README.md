# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis

Bobby's manager is concerned about his current employees reaching their retirement age. With this analysis I was able to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program helping the manager for the "silver tsunami".

## Results

1. After reviewing the list I found out they were many duplicates due to multiple positions.

2. I removed the duplicates leaving on the most recent job title.
